From our model training results:

* GaussianNB (GNB):  
  * Accuracy: 0.57  
  * F1-scores are low for some classes (e.g., class 0, 9), indicating poor performance for those classes.  
  * Macro avg f1: 0.61 (shows overall performance is not very high).  
* SVM:  
  * Accuracy: 0.93  
  * High f1-scores for almost all classes, indicating strong, balanced performance.  
  * Macro avg f1: 0.93  
* Logistic Regression (LR):  
  * Accuracy: 0.89  
  * Good f1-scores, but not as high as SVM or tree-based models.  
  * Macro avg f1: 0.89  
* Decision Tree & Random Forest:  
  * Accuracy: 0.94  
  * Very high f1-scores across all classes.  
  * Macro avg f1: 0.94
