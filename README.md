Neuro Mudra Analytics is a research project under Prof. Rajesh M. Hegde (IIT Kanpur) aimed at classifying Yogic Mudras using self-recorded EEG and EMG biosignals. We developed a unique dataset by recording biosignals from 4 participants performing 10 meditation mudras, creating a valuable resource for neuroscience and wellness research. Over 10 statistical and frequency-domain features (delta–gamma bands) were extracted from each EEG and EMG channel to capture both neurological and muscular activity patterns. Various machine learning models—including LSTM, SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees—were used for classification. To ensure robustness across users, we applied Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), significantly reducing domain shift and improving generalization. The DANN model achieved 81.82% accuracy across participants, while traditional models like Random Forest and Decision Tree reached up to 95% and 92% accuracy, respectively, on the preprocessed dataset. This work demonstrates the potential of combining yoga practices with biosignal analytics and lays the foundation for future research in neuro-yogic computing.
